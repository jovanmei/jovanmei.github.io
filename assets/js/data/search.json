This could be through the use of virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR). In this virtual world, we have 3D holographic avatars. As the metaverse expands, it will offer a hyper-real alternative world for you to coexist in. immersive adj. 沉浸式的；身临其境的 augmented adj. 增强的 holographic adj. 全息的 avatar n. 化身 hyper-real adj. 超真实的 alternative adj. 另一个的 coexist v. 共存 It generally refers to … 这通常指的是… This could be through the use of … 这可以通过使用…（来实现）Is the metaverse happening because of the pandemic?Sort of. The idea of bringing all of those activities together in one seamless digital environment is not as much of a leap as you have seen just a few years ago. Some of plans predate the pandemic, but almost two years of living mostly virtually seems likely to have accelerated it and investors now think of it as more of a possibility. seamless adj. 无缝的 leap n. 飞跃 predate v. （日期上）早于 … is not as much of a leap as … 这如…一样并不是突飞猛进What is the actual application for the metaverse?Well, as of right now, the idea for usage of the metaverse is pretty basic, business meetings, educational purposes, virtual concerts and tours. Merging virtual reality with social networking is likely to be the first step, but experts are saying it can be much more than that relying on blockchain technology to create unique items and experiences within this virtual utopia. merge v. 融合 merge sth with sth 将…和…融合 blockchain n. 区块俩 utopia n. 乌托邦When will the metaverse hit the mainstream?Mark Zuckerberg estimates it could take 5 to 10 years before the key features of the metaverse become mainstream.

Ultra-fast broadband speeds, virtual reality headsets and persistent always-on online worlds are already up and running, even though they may not be accessible to all. mainstream n. 主流 hit the mainstream loc. 进军主流 broadband n. 宽带 headset n. 头戴式视图器 always-on adj. 始终在线的 up adj. 在运转的 be accessible to sb 对…开放的What are the challenges to the metaverse?It’s clear that there are still a lot of issues that need to be worked through before we are ready to move our lives entirely online. Privacy, security and data protection are major issues moving forward with the metaverse, but what seems to be a bigger hurdle is the technology itself. High-speed Internet still isn’t as widely available as it should be and latency is sure to be an issue as well as a matter of fact. work through loc. 解决 move forward with loc. 推进；推动 hurdle n. 障碍 latency n. （网络）延迟" }, { "title": "Involution", "url": "/posts/N1/", "categories": "Life", "tags": "Life", "date": "2022-04-24 02:34:00 +0000", "snippet": "What exactly is involution?Involution, an obscure buzzword, which has been going viral since last year. It intuitively captures a kind of dilemma among present Chinese, which is an endless cycle of self-flagellation, feeling as if you’re running in place and constantly having to motivate yourself day in, day out. It would see the majority of humanity is afflicted by doubt and anxiety. That means you’re entangled with incessant rat race, but you know full well that you probably won’t get anything valid out of it.Can you quote me a situational example?If you’re with a corporate giant, a bureaucratic culture tend to make the rounds. It’s marked by a need-to-please vibe due to a self-perpetuating internal promotion mechanism. Employees are called on to conform to certain disciplines that chiefs expect to see employees work overtime off their own bats and pivot on firms’ performances. Most rarely pit themselves against the situation. How would you grapple with it? If you take on it and buckle under the authority, you’re now involuted. corporate giant loc. 大公司 bureaucratic adj. 官僚主义的 tend to do loc. 往往会 please vt. 取悦 vibe n. 氛围 self-perpetuating adj. 用不休止的 call on sb to do loc. 号召某人做某事 conform to loc. 遵守 off one’s own bat loc. 自己主动地 pivot on loc. 以…为核心 pit oneself against loc. 对抗 grapple with loc. 解决 take on loc. 承担 buckle under loc. 屈服于What do you think has led to involution?I see the roots of involution coming from is homogeneity, a strong communal meme, highly singular and uniform in terms of goals, evaluation criteria as well as methods of competition due to modern education. The form of competition leads to an extremely high degree of integration. Everyone thinks alike. Without exit mechanism is also I think at the root of much of what causes anxieties in the world and anxieties with us individually. You’re not allowed to quit. If you quit the competition, you’re left facing huge moral pressure, exposed to critique and ridicule. homogeneity n. 同质化 communal adj. 共同的 meme n. 文化基因 integration n. 一体化 be exposed to loc. 遭受 I see the roots of … coming from is … 我认为…的根源是… … is also I think at the root of much of what causes … 我认为…也是很大程度上导致…的原因How does education impact involution?In classical education, the most important function of education was to understand yourself. In modern society, however, education has been tasked with changing your destiny, and it’s now common to believe that upward mobility can be achieved through education. This then leaves students feeling lost due to involution, while teachers become frustrated at the lack of students actually interested in scholarship. If you look at more mature societies, like Europe, people are more content. It’s because they redirect their hopes and efforts. People go after what they’re good at and interested in with a sound method that works best for them. As such, our biggest problem is that the last bus has already passed, but we don’t want to start on a new path. be tasked with loc. 被委派（工作） redirect vt. 使改变方向 sound adj. 合理的 as such loc. 因此 It’s now common to believe that… 现在普遍认为…How to stop involution?On the social level, establishing an exit mechanism is of importance. The government may take the lead to move to better the present system of education sector. It should encourage diversity and differentiation rather than the concept of fame, wealth or social class. On the individual level, what I use myself, really, is a few steps. For starters, find a new path that suits you. Secondly, don’t be afraid of failure. Thirdly, focus more on the process than the objective. Fourthly, promote a spirit of craftsmanship. Fifthly, fully devote yourself to the here and now. The ways might not solve problems back and edge, but I know it’s in the unromantic raw parts that you’re able to find your powerful self. on the social level loc. 在社会层面上 take the lead loc. 牵头 move to do loc. 行动去做某事 education sector loc. 教育界 differentiation n. 差异化 on the individual level loc. 在个人层面上 spirit of craftsmanship loc. 工匠精神 the here and now loc. 当下 back and edge loc. 完全地 unromantic adj. 平淡无奇的 raw adj. 不完美的" }, { "title": "Climb Stairs", "url": "/posts/Note1/", "categories": "Life", "tags": "Life", "date": "2022-04-02 02:34:00 +0000", "snippet": "class Solution{ int[] memo; public int climbStairs(int n) { memo = new int[n + 1]; return dp(n); } int dp(int n) {\t\tif (n &lt;= 2) { return n; } if (memo[n] &gt; 0) { return memo[n]; } memo[n] = dp(n - 1) + dp(n - 2); //dynamic programming function return memo[n]; }}" }, { "title": "Unknown", "url": "/posts/Sub/", "categories": "Life", "tags": "Life", "date": "2022-03-30 02:34:00 +0000", "snippet": "Edinburgh, High Performance Computing with Data Sciencehttp://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/21-22/dpt/ptmschpcds1f.htmhttps://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&amp;edition=2022&amp;id=871Amsterdam, Computer Science - Big Data Engineeringhttps://studiegids.vu.nl/en/Master/2021-2022/computer-science-joint-degree#study-programhttps://vu.nl/en/education/master/computer-science/curriculum?year=1st-year&amp;specialization=big-data-engineering" } ]
